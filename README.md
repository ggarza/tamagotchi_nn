# How to Train Your Robot Butler üêæü§ñ
*A Playful Approach to Neural Networks and Julia Programming*

This is the repository for the seminar **How to Train Your Robot Butler** ‚Äî an exploration of neural networks, artificial intelligence, and the Julia programming language, all through the lens of building a virtual pet in the spirit of the Tamagotchi toys.

## What This Is

This seminar guides participants through the process of building a neural network from scratch in Julia. Along the way, we'll simulate a virtual pet and train a neural network to take care of it ‚Äî just like a well-mannered robot butler.

The seminar is designed for beginners. No prior experience with Julia or neural networks is required. Expect to learn by doing, tinkering, and playing.

## What You'll Build

- A simple simulation of a virtual pet, with needs like hunger, boredom, and sleep
- A neural network implemented from scratch in Julia
- A training loop that teaches your AI to keep the pet alive and happy


## Contents

This repository includes:

- `julia/`: Notebooks and example scripts for learning julia
- `pet-sim/`: Code for simulating your virtual pet
- `nn-from-scratch/`: Materials for implementing your own neural network
- `pdfs/`: PDFs of the handouts and readings
- LaTeX source files in the top-level directory for handouts, readings, and exercises

## Getting Started

To follow along, you'll need:

- Julia (the latest stable release)
- Basic familiarity with terminal/command line usage
- A sense of humor and curiosity

Start with `pdfs/proposal.pdf` or open the folder `nn-from-scratch` in your favorite Julia environment.
