\section{Overview}

This seminar introduces participants to neural networks through the lens of simulation and play. Over the course of the semester, participants will build a simple feedforward neural network from scratch in the Julia programming language and train it to care for a virtual pet, inspired by the Tamagotchi toy. Along the way, they will explore key ideas in machine learning, agent-based modeling, and programming from first principles.

\section{Participation and Structure}

Participants are expected to:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=1ex]
    \item Engage in weekly seminar sessions and hands-on activities
    \item Contribute to discussions and collaborative exploration
    \item Work on a self-directed or group project that integrates neural networks and simulation
    \item Share progress and insights throughout the semester
\end{itemize}

\section{Who Should Join}

The seminar is designed to be accessible to those with little or no prior experience in programming or machine learning. It is particularly well-suited for:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=1ex]
    \item Undergraduate students interested in data science, mathematics, computer science, or artificial intelligence
    \item Graduate students and faculty looking to explore neural networks in a hands-on, low-stakes setting
    \item Anyone curious about how machines can learn to care for digital creatures
\end{itemize}

\section{Learning Goals}

By the end of the seminar, participants will:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item Understand the basic structure and components of a feedforward neural network
    \item Gain experience programming in Julia
    \item Design and simulate a simple agent-based system
    \item Train a neural network to model behavior from data
    \item Build confidence in constructing computational models from scratch
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Virtual Pet}

As a central project, participants will create and interact with a simplified virtual pet simulator. The pet will have internal states (such as hunger, boredom, or fatigue) and respond to external actions (like feeding, playing, or resting). After defining the rules of the simulation, participants will generate training data and develop a neural network to approximate the behavior of an ideal caretaker.

\section{Tools and Materials}

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=1ex]
    \item Programming Language: Julia
    \item Coding Environment: Visual Studio Code and Pluto.jl notebooks
    \item Simulation Framework: Custom, participant-built
    \item Version Control Tools: Git and version control platforms for collaboration
\end{itemize}



\section{Expected Outcomes}

Participants will leave the seminar with:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=1ex]
    \item A functional understanding of neural networks and how they learn
    \item Practical experience with programming and debugging in Julia
    \item A working project that showcases AI behavior in a simulated environment
    \item New computational skills and creative confidence
\end{itemize}
